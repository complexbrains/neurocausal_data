# NeuroCausal: data-storage

In this repository we will be listing the parametric files that is required for the analysis pipeline to run. 
We will also share the OSF link to the downloaded open access clinical papers that will be used in [NeuroCausal](https://github.com/neurocausal/neurocausal) pipeline.

The dataset will be periodically updated as the new bunch of data added and new features are extended to the tool.
